# Advent of Code Node.js Solutions

It's the nerdiest way to count down to Christmas. Try out [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for yourself!

This codebase has solutions to some of the Advent of Code exercises (I'm a completionist so I will eventually finish all exercises for all years available). All solutions are written in Javascript ES6 and run on a Node.js server.

Check out the [src/modules](https://github.com/CallieLinux/AoCSolutions-nodejs/tree/master/src/modules) folders for the functions used in the solutions.

## Installation

Use the following commands to download and install this solution.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/CallieLinux/AoCSolutions-nodejs.git
cd AoCSolutions-nodejs

## Usage

Use the following command to start the Node.js server and get the solution.

```shell

Node.js server is configured to listen on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and will display a particular solution by navigating to a particular day.
